# Airbnb-Analysis

** Introduction

How much are people intersted in Airbnb?
The “sharing economy” concept has been embraced by governments, entrepreneurs and commentators as delivering new forms of opportunity for local and national economies.Accommodation-sharing platform Airbnb is often considered a sharing economy exemplar, and has promoted itself as helping middle-class residents to gain and retain a foothold in expensive housing markets.Besides,Airbnb is one of the largest hospitality brands in the world hosting thousands of travelers every day. 
But at June 13th, Taiwan News published a article : Taiwan is gunning for 'unlicensed rentals' with AirBnB in its crosshairs.It showed that the Taiwan government are poised to start cracking down on businesses that provide “unlicensed” accommodation across the country. It must contributes to the thriving growing economy of economy of small-scale accommodation providers and Taiwan’s tourism industry. Based on this situation, I wonder the interest trend of Airbnb in Taiwan in the past and future, and do this sort of analysis using Python and API of Google Trend.

This article will both show the analysis, the graphs of data and my perspective on it. 
We will: 

・ explore the interest trend of Airbnb in Taiwan in these years via the keyword searched most as shown on interest section. 
・ explore the interest level of different region in Taiwan via the keyword searched most as shown on region section. 
・ observe what time people search the keyword most in a day.
